# Ifc.js - 6D

## Introduction

This project was created as part of the Ifc.js crash course hackathon. The project is developed by three of the course alumni ([HassanEmam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hassanemam/), [Badr Ouhabi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ouahbi/) and [Mortiz Lill](https://www.linkedin.com/in/moritz-lill/))
The main purpose of the application is to perform 5D operations as Quantity Takeoff and 6D simulation (carbon emissions and footprint calculations). The project is a proof of concept and data used for carbon calculations are not real factors

## How to access the application

Web applications are super easy to use as they do not require any setup or installation to get started. Our web app is no different; all you need to do is to [click here to get started](https://hassanemam.github.io/ifcjs-6d/)

## Project Gallery

The project gallery includes some sample preloaded models to explaore and test the project if users do not have IFC files.However, we do allow loading of IFC file by clicking the first card in the gallery page titled "Load a new IFC file."


## Geometry Viewer Functionality
We have created mutiple tools that we believed to be useful for the purpose of the project. These tools are found in a toolbar below the 3D viewer as shown in the image below
